# Project2_C24
This project focuses on crowd counting using a dataset collected from multiple sources, including the Giraffe and graduation events. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient crowd detection model.

# Problem Statement
To enhance crowd management and public safety, our team is developing a robust crowd counting system. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, we aim to analyze and estimate crowd density in real-time, providing valuable insights for event organizers and city planners.
